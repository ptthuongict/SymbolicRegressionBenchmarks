# SymbolicRegressionBenchmarks
This project  introduces 140 Symbolic Regression benchmarks  proposed in [GEMP]. These benchmarks are grouped into four clusters based on their overfitting. Each cluster includes benchmarks with OVs are increasing with detail information shown in the reference table.
It is suggested to researchers use them as the benchmarks to study the generalization ability of Genetic Programming in particular,  and Machine Learning approaches in general, in future researches.
To see more about how to these benchmarks generated,  please see in [GEMP]. If you are interested in source code for creating these benchmark and customize it to generate a new benchmark, please look at souce code project. 
Finally, the suit of 140 Symbolic Regression benchmarks can be download at download.
